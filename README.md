# NextTask

NextTask is a final-year project focused on the design and development of an accessibility-first productivity web application, with particular focus on supporting users with executive-function challenges and visual accessibility needs.

This repository currently contains project scaffolding and documentation produced as part of Milestone 2, including architectural planning and data model design. Full implementation of the application is planned for later stages of the project.

## Project Status
This repository is under active development. At the time of submission, the focus has been on research, design, and planning rather than full system implementation.

## Technologies (Planned)
- React.js (frontend)
- Node.js / Express (backend)
- MySQL (database)

Further technical details and implementation instructions will be added as development progresses.
